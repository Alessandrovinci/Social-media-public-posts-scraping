# Social-media-public-posts-scraping

This project is about scraping public posts from Facebook's search bar based on an input query defined by the user.
The user needs to insert an input which corresponds to what he would look for in the social's search bar. Moreover, there is the possibility to write a list of terms that will then be highlighted if found within the posts extracted.

The algorithm is based on Python and Selenium. Hence to run the code it will be necessary to access the social's account page.
